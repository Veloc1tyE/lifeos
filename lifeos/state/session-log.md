## 2026-01-14 | Session 004 | AFTERNOON — LIFEOS UPGRADES

**Trigger:** Manual continuation
**Time:** ~14:00-16:00 GST

### Infrastructure Upgrades

**Endurance Score (Primary Training Metric)**
- Added full section to CLAUDE.md Pillar 2
- Monthly targets: Jan 5800-6200 → May 8500-9000 (UTA 100 race band)
- Guardrails: Green/Yellow/Red decision framework
- Dashboard UI: input field + trend chart with target zones
- Created `dashboard-import-with-endurance.json` with historical data
- Garmin API tested — doesn't expose Endurance Score, manual entry required

**Elliptical Vertical Reference**
- Added quick reference card to CLAUDE.md
- Standard 30-min session = 18-20 floors (~55-60m)
- Sunday workflow: tally sessions → sum floors → update vert

**Task Summary Protocol**
- Added to CLAUDE.md after Response Style
- Must read current-week.json before generating task summaries
- Critical = longer tasks; quick loops → backlog
- Prevents missing psych/RTW/admin items

### State Updates
- Updated critical 3: removed gym (REST), removed balances (done)
- Remaining: Capital motion (deep work) + sublet search (critical)
- Backlog: 9 open loops including WorkCover, RTW, Arabic, TAQA

### Training Decision
- REST today. No evening session.
- Endurance Score: 5628 (approaching Jan target 5800-6200)

### Handoff
- Next: Evening shutdown or tomorrow morning
- Check: Capital motion progress, sublet status, backlog closures
- Sunday: Calculate elliptical vert, update dashboard
